A data analysis project for DSCI 522 (Data Science workflows); a course in the Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia.

## About

With a banking institution's telemarketing campaign data, we are attempting to build a classification model using the Logistice Regression algorithm to help us identify and pursue customers that will subscribe to a term deposit product. Our final classification model has reasonable performance on the test data, with a f1-score of 0.6 and a recall score of 0.90. On the 8238 test data cases, we correctly predicted 7091. However, it incorrectly predicted 1147 cases with 1056 being false positives and 91 being false negatives. We were more focused on reducing false negatives to capture more revenue. The false positives are also important as it may require more resources to reach out to potential customers, but our bias was towards revenue (recall). This model is not sufficient to be used in the industry since the f-1 score still has a lot to improve on. We recommend continuing to improve the classification performance before we use this in production.  


The data set used in this project is from from a marketing campaign of a Portuguese bank and created by S. Moro, P. Cortez and P. Rita (Moro, Cortez, and Rita 2014). It was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (@ Dua and Graff 2017) and can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing). Each row in the data set represents summary statistics with detail information of the contacted client, including bank client info (e.g. age, job, loan experience, etc.), other campaign attributes (e.g. number of contact, previous campaign outcome, etc) and social and economic attributes. (e.g. consumer confidence index, euribor rate, etc.) They were using telemarketing to attempt to get customers to sign up for the bank's term deposit product. The target in this dataset is yes or no to subscribing to the term deposit product.

## Report

The report can be found [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_522_Group_10/main/doc/bank_marketing_predict_report.html).

## Usage

There are two suggested ways to run this analysis:

### 1. Using Docker

Note - the instructions in this section also depends on running this in a unix shell (e.g., terminal or Git Bash)

To replicate the analysis, install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started). Then clone this GitHub repository and run the following command at the command line/terminal from the root directory of this project:

```
docker run --rm -v /$(pwd):/home/rstudio/bank_tele_campaign_analysis jufu/ubcmds_522_group10_bank:v0.3.0 make -C /home/rstudio/bank_tele_campaign_analysis all
```

To reset the repo to a clean slate with no intermediate and result files, run the following command from the root directory of this project:
```
docker run --rm -v /$(pwd):/home/rstudio/bank_tele_campaign_analysis jufu/ubcmds_522_group10_bank:v0.3.0 make -C /home/rstudio/bank_tele_campaign_analysis clean
```

### 2. Without using Docker

To replicate the analysis, clone this GitHub repository, install the [dependencies](#dependencies) listed below, and run the following commands at the command line/terminal from the root directory of this project:

```
#Activate the Conda environment first
conda activate bank

make all

```

To reset the repo to a clean slate with no intermediate and result files, run the following command from the root directory of this project:

```
make clean
```
